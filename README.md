This is a Disney/Cartoon quiz
The timer goes down by 60 seconds for each wrong answer
I tried to make the time change color when time decreases 
I have commented the 3 colors for when the time was lowering, one for when the time was low and one for normal time
I will be fixing the color change on the timer soon
But as you can see the quiz works, the timer works, the time decrease works as well.
